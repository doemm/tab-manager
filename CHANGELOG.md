# Release Changelog

Changelog records all the updates in each release. It provides the information to users of what are added, changed, or fixed in all release versions. The changelog should include version, date, a brief summary of the release, and generalization of code change into 3 categories: added, changed, and fixed. It is an essential way to communicate with users about new features.
