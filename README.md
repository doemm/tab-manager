# Tab Manager

Tab Manager is a browser extension that helps you to manage all the tabs. The philosophy behind it is to manage all the tabs within the current window. It is often the case that there should not be more than 2 or 3 browser windows opened. Thus, the extension itself has a limited or no support for managing multi-window tabs. It is also not planned to add any multi-window tabs support in the future. However, feel free to give any suggestions or design ideas.

The extension works on Chrome and Firefox and have not tested on other browsers. You can download from the links below:

## Features Exploration

## Contribute to Codebase

Most of the code is written in pure JavaScript. The drag and drop feature is using the support from dragula API. Please feel free to create issues and PRs to contribute to the project.

Currently, we are planning to move the code to TypeScript and separate some of the functionalities for easier maintainability.
